Homework 0 is all about being prepared.  Install *ALL* the required software (OR use Rstudio.cloud).  For the submission, please knit to pdf the default document as described below, print and bring to class.  This is the *ONLY* homework you will turn in via a printed copy.

1. File --> New File --> R Markdown
2. Fill in Author (you) and title (Homework 1)
3. click the pdf toggle and hit ok
4. click the knit pulldown and choose "knit to pdf"
5. save it where ever you like
6. print the resulting pdf and bring to first class

### Required software (all free, install in order -- only if using Rstudio on laptop)

Package         Source
-------         --------------------------------
Git:            https://git-scm.com/
Github:         https://github.com (account) 
Docker:         https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
LaTeX:          https://miktex.org/
R:              https://cran.r-project.org/  
Rstudio:        http://rstudio.com/  
-------         --------------------------------

Note, on some platforms, LaTeX seems to be a royal PITA usually due to a previous installation.  If you have troubles, try installing the R package *tiny_tex*.  In this class, you are required to knit direct to pdf.  To test this, do "File -> New File -> R Markdown", choose the PDF toggle, click "ok", then simply "Knit to pdf".  If this works, you are good to go and you have your first homework assignment.

### Preperation for next homework:  
We will be using Git for *ALL* future assignments.  Make sure your computing platform is setup by following the instructions given on the course website under __submitting homework__.  To test your setup, add/commit/push the file you created and knitted in the last problem.  If you have questions or problems, see me.  Additionally, if you have time, please follow the git tutorial at:
