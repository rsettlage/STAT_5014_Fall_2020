This is a sample of how I would like the homework to look when turned in.

This is a sample of how I would like the homework to look when turned in.  _It will look a bit better imo, because you will knit to pdf rather than html as shown here._

# Homework 1 
# Your Name 
# Date

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
##### 
##### 
##### Project setup #####
##### 
##### 
##### 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
library(stargazer)
##### 
##### 
```

## Problem 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this, note that `kable` makes REALLY nice tables with ZERO effort as seen in Table 1.  Don't just print output to consol, use kable!!  In my opinion, including code to create tables in-line is a detraction, this is simple to show you how easy it is to do it.  Code that is relevant to the problem should be included, code that is for display or as a summary, should be omitted in-line and it is up to you on if it should be included in an Appendix.

```{r Problem1a}
##### 
##### 
##### Problem 1: Data summary #####
##### output using kable
##### 
##### 
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption = "Quick summary of car data.")
```

Likewise, `stargazer` simplifies making tables of linear model output.  See Table 2 below.  See how simple??  Note that you don't need to set the type AND it will look better when knit to pdf.
 
```{r Problem1b, results='asis'}
##### 
##### 
##### Problem 1: Quick lm #####
##### output using Stargazer
##### 
##### 
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
stargazer(fit,header = F,type = "html")
```

## Problem 2

You can also embed plots and have Rmarkdown figure out the figure number automatically.  Make sure and name the code chuck and then reference the figure using `\@ref(fig:Problem2a)`. See Figure \@ref(fig:Problem2a) for example: 

```{r Problem2a, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
##### 
##### 
##### Problem 2: plot #####
##### making a pie chart
##### 
#####  
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```

# Appendix 1: R code

If you name the code chucks, it is easy to include code not really important to the main text but necessary as an Appendix.  For instance:

```{r Appendix, ref.label=c("setup","Problem1a","Problem1b","Problem2a"), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, include=T}
  
```
