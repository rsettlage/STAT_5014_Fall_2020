# Basics of R and Rmarkdown

An R Notebook, similar to an Rmarkdown file, contains both text and code in blocks.  These are weaved together to give a final document.  First, let's talk about the text.  The Markdown code we are using is roughly speaking, $\LaTeX$.  Here are a few things you will find useful:

equation or eqnarray, note you can add a $\ast$ to get rid of line numbers.
\begin{eqnarray}
L(\underline{x} \mid p) & = & \prod_{i=1}^N p^{x_i}(1-p)^{1-x_i} \\
    & = & p^{\sum x_i}(1-p)^{N-\sum x_i}
\end{eqnarray}

If you want it to render in-line, use the double \$\$:
$$p(x)=p^x(1-p)^{1-x}$$

You can even combine text and computations.  The sum of 5 and 3 is `r 5+3`.  Or, `5+3=` `r 5+3`.  After a code chunk is run, you have access to the values in any of the variables resident in memory.  More on that later.

Need a symbol:

Need a symbol and don't know its name:

Let's start with some basic R command shortcuts that will save you some time.

* To save R script, use:  
        control+S (both Windows and Mac)  
        command+S (Mac only)
* To quit, type:  
        q()
* To execute a line, use:  
        control+R or control enter (Window)  
        control-enter or command-enter (Mac)  
* To clear the consol, use:  
        control+L  
        

Let's move to commands that will work in scripts or at the R prompt:

```{r eval=T, echo=T, include=T}
# set working directory.
setwd("./")

# In Unix, Mac, you always use forward slash. 
# In windows, you can use forward slash, or double backward slash.
# C:/Users/hongxiaozhu/Documents/ (Windows)
# C:\\Users\\hongxiaozhu\\Documents (Windows)

# Install packages.
#install.packages('spuRs',repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")
library(spuRs) # load in a package.
require(spuRs) # equivalent to library()
find.package('spuRs')

# Use help.
#?plot
#help('/')

# Basic arithmetic
2+3
2-3
2*3
2/3
exp(2)
log(2)
sqrt(2)
pi
 # modular (13/5 = 2 remainder 3; or 13 mod 5 = 3)
13%%5
 # integer division (the integer part of the quotient)
13%/%5
 # round
round(13/5)

#A trick.
#x<
# When you see '+' symbol, to get out of the
# '+', press esc. 
  
# list files in directory
# list all files in your working directory.
dir("./")


# define a variable and assign values. 
    # assign 3.0 to x. 
    # assign using arrow. 
    # add () to print out the value. 

# list all variables in memory. 


# clear all variables in memory. 


# Different ways to name a variable. 
a = 1    # lower case letter
A = 1    # upper case letter
a_1 = 2.0    # underscore
a.1 = 2    # dot
.er <- 1    # more dots.


gender = 'MALE'    # can be a character string.
class(gender)
var1 = TRUE    # can be logic expression 
class(var1)   # find out the type of the variable

# (13) save objects in memory to .RData file.  
x = 1
y = 4
    # save
    # save.image

# load in a .RData workspace.
rm(list=ls())

```


Let's end this with a quick look at the homework.
